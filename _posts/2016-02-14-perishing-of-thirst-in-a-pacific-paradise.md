description: "MAJURO, Marshall Islands -- A few yards from the crashing waves of the Pacific, on a precariously narrow strip of land, precious rainwater pools on the runway of the Marshall Islands' main airport. This is how the government hydrates tens of thousands of its citizens: the rainwater runoff from the airstrip."

This past weekend we have traded our scorching sun for a very welcome downpour.  The first real rain for nearly 2 months couldn't have come soon enough when many families only have a single 1500 gallon tank for a single household. Not enough to break the drought that holds us, but just enough to wet our lips and bring us back from teetering over the edge.
